﻿# Complete Unity Developer 2D - Number Wizard Console

This is the [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub) - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects and our latest teaching techniques. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught nearly half a million students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub)

## In This Section
Basic introduction to coding using C# (ref: NC_CUD)

## How To Build / Compile

## Lecture List
Here are the lectures of the course for this section. In future sections you will also be able to see all the code we add and remove in each lecture, but more about that later!


### 1 Welcome To Number Wizard Console ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Overview of this section
2. Code is mostly the same as the original code
3. Let's get started!


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
Ready and raring to start.


### 2 Print To Console With Debug.Log() ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Understand the game flow for the simple game we are making.
2. Use Debug.Log() to print our welcome to the player
3. Add three additional statements to give the player the requirements


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
Be able to print to the console using Debug.Log().


### 3 Introducing Variables ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Discuss that variables are like boxes which store data.
2. Create an integer variable to store our maximum guess value.
3. Create an integer variable to store our minimum guess value.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
Be capable of creating an integer type variable.


### 3b Fixing Visual Studio Problems ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Checklist for troubleshooting if Visual Studio seems to be not working properly.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
Armed with knowledge on how to fix Visual Studio problems.


### 4 Respond To Player Input ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Problem solving discussion using Unity docs.
2. Use Input.GetKeyDown() to recognise when a key is pressed.
3. Use the KeyCode keyword to determine which key is pressed.
4. Discuss white space, code blocks and bracketing. 
5. Introduce commenting.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
Understand how to recognise player input using Input.GetKeyDown().


### 5 Using if, else if & else ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Consider the problem we have of multiple key presses being possible.
2. Discuss the difference between if, else if & else conditional statements.
3. Implement an approach that makes our key presses mutually exclusive of one another.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
Use if and else if statements to make key presses mutually exclusive.


### 6 Scope And Context Of Variables ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Discuss how C# is organised / grouped.
2. Address the problem of scope and with our variables not being accessible.
3. Create a guess variable.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Be cool with how scope applies to declaring and using variables.


### 7 Calculate Guess Variable ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Implement the simple calculation to guess the midpoint of our min and max.
2. Fix an issue with the maximum guess not reaching 1000.
3. Tidy up our text.
4. Use github to access our code updates and lecture changes.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Implement a simple calculation that updates our guess based upon player feedback.


### 8 Functions & Encapsulating ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Create a new function for StartGame().
2. Create a new function for NextGuess().
3. Discussion encapsulating as it relates to C#.
4. Finish our game.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Create your first functions and finish off our simple game.


### 9 Number Wizard Console Wrap Up ###

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Great work for completing this section.
2. You're not supposed to understand everything yet.
3. Keep pushing forward into the next section.


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Celebrate completing this section and push on to the next one.
